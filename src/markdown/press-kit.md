Candy Raid: The Factory started out as an entry to Ludum Dare 41. Our team consisted of Kayne Ruse and Evan Hartshorn, two longtime indie game developers who had just met online. The prototype was written in just 3 days and, while it didn't really follow the theme, it was solid enough to score in the top 100 for the "fun" category.

We knew we had a potentially interesting concept with switching elements and using those elements to sovle puzzles, so we spent the next four months working on a more fleshed out version, rebuilding everything from the ground up. Graphics, mechanics and music were all completely replaced - the only thing that survived was the main character's sprite.

We hired Luis Paez, who was new to game soundtracks, as an extrenal contractor to fufill our need for audio.

None of us had worked together before, but this project has led to several others, and longtime friendships.
